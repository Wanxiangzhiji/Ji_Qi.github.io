Hi, Everyone, my name is Ji Qi. Welcome to my personal websit!👋👋 Nice to meet you all!😀😊

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Systems Engineering department at George Washington University, working with Pro. Caitlin Grady in our FEWsLab👑. I hold a Master’s degree in Management Science and Engineering (Industrial Engineering) from Tianjin University and a Bachelor's degree in Economic Statistics from Zhengzhou University. 

In the past, I have interned with leading companies across various industries, including Deloitte Consulting, JD Technology, and Taikang Life Insurance. I am passionate about researching data-driven models and mathematical optimization, particularly their applications in decision sciences and policy analysis.

His past work includes resilience analysis of financial risk networks and the application of reinforcement learning in industrial system degradation modeling. 

Currently, my research focuses on nitrogen emission management and policy analysis within the sustainable agriculture framework🌏, with the goal of formulating data-driven policy insights through network and risk analysis to support sustainable development goals.
