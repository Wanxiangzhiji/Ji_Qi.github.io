Hi, Everyone, my name is Ji Qi. Nice to meet you all!ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜Š

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Systems Engineering department at George Washington University. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Management Science and Engineering (Industrial Engineering) from Tianjin University and a Bachelor's degree in Economic Statistics from Zhengzhou University. 

In the past, I have interned with leading companies across various industries, including Deloitte Consulting, JD Technology, and Taikang Life Insurance. I am passionate about researching data-driven models and mathematical optimization and their applications in decision sciences.

My previous research includes resilience analysis of financial risk networks and the application of reinforcement learning in industrial system degradation modeling. 

Currently, my research focuses on nitrogen emission management and policy analysis within the framework of sustainable agriculture.
